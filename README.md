# Dygma Raise Schematics

[Dygma's](http://www.dygma.com/) Raise Keyboard will be open source hardware and software.

As we are still working on the hardware prototype, and potentially changing main microcontroller in the near future,
only the current schematics are posted.

As the hardware becomes finalised we will move each schematic and pcb into a sub directory here.

Thanks,

The Dygma Team.
